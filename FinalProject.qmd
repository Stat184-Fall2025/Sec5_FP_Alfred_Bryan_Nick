##Exploratory Data Analysis
The code below looks at some summary statistics on pitching stats for the last 25 years.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
pitchingData <- read.csv("PitchingData.csv")
```

```{r}
era_mean <- mean(pitchingData$ERA)
era_median <- median(pitchingData$ERA)
era_sd <- sd(pitchingData$ERA)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = pitchingData, aes(x=Year,y=ERA)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title="Pitching ERA Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y= "ERA") +
  theme_minimal()
```

##Summary Statistics Grouped by Pitcher Age
```{r}
summary_table <- pitchingData %>%
  group_by(pitchingData$PAge) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_col = mean(pitchingData$ERA),
    median_col = median(pitchingData$ERA),
    sd_col = sd(pitchingData$ERA),
    n_obs = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
print(summary_table)
```
